# üß† Multi-Disease Prediction App

## üìå Project Summary

The **Multi-Disease Prediction App** is a machine learning-based web application developed using the Python **Streamlit** framework. Its purpose is to help users assess their risk of various diseases by entering commonly available medical data.

This application allows the prediction of the following **nine diseases**:

- Diabetes
- Heart Disease
- Parkinson's Disease
- Cardio Disease
- Hepatitis
- Liver Disease
- Ocular Disease
- Thyroid Disease
- Multiple Sclerosis

Each disease prediction is powered by a dedicated machine learning model trained on respective **Kaggle datasets**. The application provides predictions interactively, with a user-friendly interface and audio feedback.
